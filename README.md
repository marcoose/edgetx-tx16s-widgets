# EdgeTX Custom Widgets for Radiomaster TX16S

## TX16SDocs
A simple widget that displays a .png file with the same name as the
currently loaded model from IMAGES/TX16SDocs.  It has no options/setup.

This widget is intended to display full screen images generated from
[https://marcoose.github.io/tx16s-docs/](https://marcoose.github.io/tx16s-docs/)

It generates 'documentation' images to provide a reminder of how your
switches, pots, and trims are configured when you switch between many models
and can't always remember how you set them up when you get out to the field.

Add the widget to a separate 'Main view' using 'Full screen' (with all display
elements turned off) or 'App mode' layout.  Navigate to and from the screen
from your main model layout(s) with the `Page >` and `Page <` buttons.
